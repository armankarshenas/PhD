# PhD main repo

This repository contains directories for different projects that I have worked on in Hernan Garcia's lab. I will use this repo to version control my scripts and collaborate with others. Once scripts used here are published, I will move them to a new public repository that could be accessed by reviewers and others. I will try to keep this README file updated with new repositories. For now the repo has the following directories: 

1. Reg-seq - trying deep learning models on sequence space-expression data to see if we can predict information footprint 
2. Optogenetics - trying to develop new methodologies to tag and observe gene expression using optogenetics 
3. Fly-libraries - trying to integrate repressor and activators needed for Eve2 expression (Hb, Bcd, Giant, Kr respectively).
